# Python-Analyzing-NYC-Apartment-Rents

In this project, I will apply data importing and cleaning skills to uncover insights about the Airbnb market in New York City.
Data is from various sources and in different formats, hence I used data manipulation techniques to clean the data and make it anaylsis ready.

This project focusses on answering the following question:
What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
How many adverts are for private rooms?
How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
